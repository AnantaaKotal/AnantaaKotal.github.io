Hi! I'm Naresh. I'm a Computer Vision Engineer at [Verkada](https://www.verkada.com/). I got my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech. At Virginia Tech, I was advised by [Dr. Sujith Vijayan](https://neuroscience.vt.edu/people/core-faculty/vijayan-s.html) and worked in the [Neural Dynamics and Neural Engineering Lab](https://www.vijayan.neuroscience.vt.edu/).
I am primarily interested in machine learning and linear algebra. During my time at Virginia Tech, I was working on developing an Intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) based Brain-Computer Interface device.

### Here are some of my favorite projects I have worked on:

* [Adversarial Autoencoder blogs](https://github.com/Naresh1318/Adversarial_Autoencoder): My series of adversarial autoencoder blogs
* [SimplyServe](https://github.com/Naresh1318/simplyServe): My version of google drive. I admit it's nowhere as functional and as nice as Drive, but, it has some cool little things in it that I find myself using regularly.
* [Dopamine](https://github.com/Naresh1318/Dopamine): Allows one to play multi-player pong and spell characters using 
Brain-Computer Interface. Built this for a module in my Introduction to Neuroscience Lab TA class at Virginia Tech. Here's a media [link](https://video.vt.edu/media/Neuroscience+students+play+Pong+with+their+brains/1_iisvk154).
* [Topaz](https://github.com/Naresh1318/Topaz): Website you are currently on :)

### Some cool blog posts/papers I recently read:
* [Linear Time Median Finding](https://rcoh.me/posts/linear-time-median-finding/): A simple algorithm to find median in linear time
* [Objects as points](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07850): I think this is a pretty neat and efficient way to find object bounding boxes
* [Deformable Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06211): Deformable convolutions to model geometric transformations is an elegant idea

I like reading papers and enjoy building stuff for the sake of it. If you are working on something and think I might be of help, let me know at \<rnaresh dot n _at_ gmail dot com>.
