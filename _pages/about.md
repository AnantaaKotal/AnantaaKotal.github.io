I'm Anantaa, a new Assistant Professor of Computer Science at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). My research is all about the exciting world of **Generative AI** and its intersection with **privacy and security**—I’m passionate about finding innovative ways to protect sensitive information while still making the most out of data.

This Fall, I’ll be teaching Data Mining, and I’m thrilled to connect with students who share my enthusiasm for these cutting-edge topics. Whether you’re interested in exploring the complexities of data privacy or diving into the fascinating possibilities of generative AI, I’d love to chat with you.

I recently earned my PhD at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where I had the privilege of working under Dr. Anupam Joshi. Now that I’m in El Paso, I’m also looking for recommendations on great food spots and fun things to do around town—so feel free to reach out with suggestions!
